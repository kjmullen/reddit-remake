# Hard Mode
# Implement the voting system.
# Both comments and posts can
# be voted up and down it is
# your choice how this is
# implemented in the system.
# One note is that you probably
# want to store the up and down
# votes individually with timestamps
#
# Comments and Posts should have
# methods that allow for them to
# calculate the total value of
# up-votes - down-votes.
#
# Implement karma. Reddit has
# 2 karma indicators link karma
# and comment karma. For this
# project both karma are calculated
# as the sum of each itemâ€™s total
# (from previous objective).
#
# Implement the ManyToMany
# Relationship with Trophies
#
# Posts can be sorted in a few
# ways in reddit. Implement
# the following as described.
# You will need to do these in
# the django shell and add a
# python file with the code as
# part of your project.
#
# -New: Chronologically newest to oldest
    # Post.objects.all().order_by("-created_at")
# -Top: Highest rated for the last 24 hours
    # Post.objects.filter(created_at__gte=today).order_by("-rating")
# -Hot: Ordered by amount of up-votes in the 3 hours
    # Post.objects.filter(created_at__gte=three_hours)
    # .order_by("-rating in last 3 hours")

# -Controversial: Ordered by posts with a high number
#  of both up and down votes
#
# -The User object is part of the core auth library.
#  There are a few ways to extend its functionality.
#  Historically, the way it works is that you create
#  a profile object with a OneToOne relationship to User.
#  Implement this object then create
#  methods on it to retrieve:
#
# Link karma for the user
#
# Comment karma for the user
#
# Average up-votes
#
# Average down-votes
#
# Total counts for comments and links
